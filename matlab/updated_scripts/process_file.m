% This script takes in a floating point complex IQ recording containing DroneID bursts and demodulates each burst
% The steps are:
%   - Find all bursts in the file using the first ZC sequence
%   - Low pass filter each burst
%   - Adjust for frequency offset based on the offset found using the first OFDM symbol's cyclic prefix
%   - Extract each OFDM symbol
%   - Quantize/Demodulate all data carriers
%   - Validate that the first symbol XOR's to all zeros
%   - Pass XOR'd bits from all other data symbols to a C++ program that removes the LTE and rate matching
%   - Print out each frame in hex
